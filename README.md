Trade With Your Future Self

If you want to work 3/4 of your time, you click the dot's speed an inch up when working and 3 inches down when taking breaks. Breaks cost 3 units of average work. It will stay near the middle when you're on target.

Point on side of screen moves up and down at speed you change with 1 click. Speed is seen as another point where it will be in 10 minutes. Set the speed upward to as fast as you're getting work done. When you take a break, set the speed downward. Save break times for later or take them now. It will track your progress. The position of the dot feels like money you trade with your future self.

This is a thin bar on the left side of your screen with 2 moving dots and 1 dot to show the center. One dot moves really slow, and the other chooses its direction and speed.

The objective is to instantly motivate yourself when hard things come up, in exchange for reducing your motivation when things are easier since you dont need it then.

To use this app, first do this: Download the file and doubleclick it. The thin bar appears on the left of your screen.

To raise your motivation, left click higher to pay yourself more (of whatever the downward direction means to you) per time. You get less time of work done but are able to push through it. Similarly you can lower your motivation in exchange for longer working time.

If you feel you've accumulated too much height, either charge yourself a little more per break time or start at any chosen height with a right click.

You should find yourself always just the right amount of motivated to work. You will therefore work longer since you're not wasting motivation. You can also adjust how much value you feel in the breaks by adjusting their cost. You gain control of your motivation and can trade it between now and your near future.

Like an engine needs gears to torque it to start, so does motivation. Chosen speed of this dot is the torque of motivation, like money.
